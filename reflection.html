     What I have learned over the past few months about this class is that it taught me how to code a website.
    It introduced me to a lot of new things and a lot fo terms that are used int his space.
    It taught me how to use tables and be able to learn how to properly implement CSS styles into anything that we want.
    It gifted me with knowledge with what to do when making an entire website by myself but showed basic functionality, which is a great start.


    This was a great class, there were a lot fo dchoices that helped influences any knowledge I had on code and proved massively onit.
    I think for the future, what may hold for future students is them being able to know what was passed down from this class' students, to them.
    To help enhance things more, you can show them how each functionality is portrayed and where it can help them with their site.
    All around, this was a great experience.
